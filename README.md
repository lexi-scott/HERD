## Decription

- HERD. is a livestock tracking software that allows the modern rancher to add & collect data on their livestock including location, parents and vaccination status. HERD. is devoted taking agriculture into the 21st century and works alongside clients to deliver a fully customized application. 

- Users will be able to add and track their live-stock within a database (Vaccine, tagID, last known location, parentID, age, known illneness, notes) conviently displayed on a dashboard page. 

- The agricultural industry has relied on generationally passed knowledge for financial success. HERD. will incorporate a rancher’s intuition with scalable data to continue to support America’s farmers. Rancher’s can track and analyze livestock for optimal results financially and for the health of the animal.



## Learning Moments
- Connecting Routes was a challenge that our team faced head on. It was a collaborative effort to continue to problem solve. 
- Use of Partials was another new trial and error that allowed us to get some practice and learn from eachother. 
- Lodash was a new addition that we implemented into our application, one of many npm packages that we looked at to try out during this deployment. 
- Deploying to heroku was a newer process that we have only done a handful of times up to now. 

## Future Development
Live Tracking Feature
    - Scan barcode on cattle and link to tagID in cattle database
    - Connect web application to live GPS tracker data from each cow
    - Display cattle location on map
    - Set boundaries and get notified if cattle escapes property

Biometric Data Tracking
    - Collect temperature, heart rate, and other measures to indicate health
    - Cattle movement and velocity to understand physical activity

Multiple Users on One Ranch
    - Currently, only one user can access the data of one ranch
    - We will add a feature that allows multiple ranchers to access the same ranch database
